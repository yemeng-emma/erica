Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Erica Lin. I am 6 years old, a first-grader at the Montessori program at BVE. My Chinese name is 林瑾怡 (Lin Jinyi). "Jin" means beautiful jade and good virtues and "Yi" means joy.

On this website, I work with my mom to post my journals, homeworks, artworks, and other fun things we do. Hope you like it!
